# Farmers' Marketplace Deployment Guide

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- Frontend: React + Vite application
- Backend: Node.js + Express API
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache: Redis (for session management and real-time data)
- WebSocket Server: Socket.IO
- File Storage: AWS S3 (for crop images)

### Integration Points
1. Authentication Service
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Endpoints: `/api/auth/*`
   - Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes

2. Crop Management
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Image upload to S3

3. Order Processing
   - Payment gateway integration (Stripe)
   - Order status webhooks
   - Real-time notifications

4. Analytics Engine
   - Demand prediction API
   - Market trend analysis
   - Regional insights

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
1. Development (dev)
   - Branch: develop
   - Auto-deploy to development environment
   - Feature flags enabled

2. Staging (staging)
   - Branch: staging
   - Mirror of production
   - Integration testing

3. Production (prod)
   - Branch: main
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Automated rollback capability

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code Quality
   - ESLint
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests

2. Security Checks
   - Dependency scanning
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - Container scanning

3. Deployment Steps
   - Build artifacts
   - Run tests
   - Deploy to environment
   - Health checks
   - Notify team

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Compute Resources
- Application Servers: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM
- Database: 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM
- Cache: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM
- Load Balancer: AWS ALB

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling for application servers
- Read replicas for database
- Redis cluster for cache
- CDN for static assets

### Monitoring Stack
- Application: New Relic
- Logs: ELK Stack
- Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
- Alerts: PagerDuty

### Security Measures
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- DDoS protection
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Regular security audits
- Data encryption at rest
